# Making a Payment with TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful language that allows developers to write more structured and error-free code. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use TypeScript to make a payment using a payment processing service.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you'll need to have the following:

- Basic knowledge of TypeScript
- A payment processing service account (we'll be using Stripe for this tutorial)
- A basic understanding of how payment processing works

## Setting Up the Project

First, let's create a new TypeScript project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
mkdir payment-processing && cd payment-processing
npm init -y
npm install --save stripe @types/stripe
```

This will create a new directory called `payment-processing`, initialize a new npm project, and install the Stripe package along with its TypeScript definitions.

Next, create a new file called `index.ts` in the root of the project directory.

## Configuring Stripe

To use Stripe in our TypeScript project, we need to configure it with our API keys. You can find your API keys in the Stripe dashboard.

Create a new file called `.env` in the root of the project directory and add the following:

```
STRIPE_API_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
```

Make sure to replace `<your-stripe-secret-key>` with your actual secret API key.

Next, create a new file called `config.ts` in the root of the project directory and add the following code:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import Stripe from "stripe";

dotenv.config();

export const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY, {
  apiVersion: "2020-08-27",
});
```

This code imports the `dotenv` package and the `stripe` package, configures `dotenv` to load the environment variables from the `.env` file, and creates a new instance of the `Stripe` class with our API key.

## Creating a Payment Intent

To process a payment with Stripe, we need to create a Payment Intent. A Payment Intent represents a single payment attempt from a customer.

In `index.ts`, add the following code to create a Payment Intent:

```typescript
import { stripe } from "./config";

async function createPaymentIntent(amount: number, currency: string) {
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount,
    currency,
  });
  return paymentIntent.client_secret;
}

const amount = 1000; // $10.00
const currency = "usd";

createPaymentIntent(amount, currency).then((clientSecret) => {
  console.log(`Payment intent created: ${clientSecret}`);
});
```

This code imports the `stripe` object from `config.ts`, defines an asynchronous function called `createPaymentIntent` that takes an `amount` and a `currency` parameter, and creates a new Payment Intent using the `stripe.paymentIntents.create` method. Finally, the code logs the client secret of the Payment Intent to the console.

## Handling Payments on the Client Side

Now that we've created a Payment Intent on the server side, we need to handle the payment on the client side. We'll be using Stripe Elements to create a form that collects the customer's payment information and sends it to Stripe for processing.

In `index.html`, add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Payment Processing</title>
    <script src="https://js.stripe.com
```
